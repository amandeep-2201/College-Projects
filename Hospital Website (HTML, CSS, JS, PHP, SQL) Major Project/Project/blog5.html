        <h3>LASIK Surgery: What to Expect and Who Is a Candidate</h3>
        <p> Dr. Anita Sethi | Mar 05, 2024<br><br>

            LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) surgery has revolutionized vision correction, offering millions of people around the world the opportunity to reduce or eliminate their dependence on glasses or contact lenses. Understanding what to expect from LASIK surgery and who is a suitable candidate for the procedure is essential for individuals considering this life-changing treatment.<br><br>

            <b>What is LASIK Surgery?</b><br><br>
            
            LASIK surgery is a type of refractive surgery that uses a laser to reshape the cornea, the transparent front part of the eye, to improve vision. By altering the curvature of the cornea, LASIK can correct common refractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism, allowing light rays to focus more precisely on the retina for clearer vision.<br><br>
            
            <b>What to Expect During LASIK Surgery:</b><br><br>
            
            <b>1.     Pre-operative Evaluation:</b> Before undergoing LASIK surgery, you will undergo a comprehensive eye examination to assess your candidacy for the procedure. This evaluation will include measurements of your corneal thickness, refractive error, pupil size, and overall eye health.<br>

            <b>2.     Surgical Procedure:</b> On the day of surgery, numbing eye drops will be applied to ensure comfort throughout the procedure. A specialized instrument called a microkeratome or femtosecond laser is used to create a thin flap in the outer layer of the cornea. The flap is then gently lifted, and an excimer laser is used to reshape the underlying corneal tissue according to your unique prescription. The flap is repositioned, where it adheres naturally without the need for sutures.<br>

<b>3.     Duration:</b> LASIK surgery is typically quick, with the actual laser treatment taking only a few seconds per eye. The entire procedure for both eyes usually takes around 15 minutes.<br>

<b>4.     Recovery:</b> After LASIK surgery, you may experience temporary discomfort, dryness, or mild irritation in the eyes. Most patients notice an improvement in vision immediately after the procedure, with further enhancement over the following days.<br>

<b>5.     Follow-up Care:</b> Your eye surgeon will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your healing progress and ensure optimal visual outcomes. It is essential to attend all post-operative appointments and adhere to any instructions provided by your surgeon for the best results.<br><br>

<b>Who Is a Candidate for LASIK Surgery?</b><br><br>

While LASIK surgery can offer significant benefits for many individuals, not everyone is a suitable candidate for the procedure. Ideal candidates for LASIK surgery typically meet the following criteria:<br><br>

<b>1.     Stable Refractive Error: </b>Candidates should have a stable refractive error, meaning their prescription has remained relatively unchanged for at least one year.<br>

<b>2.     Healthy Eyes:</b> Candidates should have overall healthy eyes, free from conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, or severe dry eye syndrome.<br>

<b>3.     Adequate Corneal Thickness: </b>Sufficient corneal thickness is essential for the creation of a corneal flap during LASIK surgery. Candidates with thin or irregular corneas may not be suitable for LASIK but may be eligible for alternative procedures such as PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy) or SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction).<br>

<b>4.     Realistic Expectations:</b> Candidates should have realistic expectations about the outcomes of LASIK surgery. While the majority of patients achieve significant improvement in vision, perfection cannot be guaranteed, and some individuals may still require glasses or contact lenses for certain activities following LASIK.<br>

<b>5.     Age:</b> While there is no strict age limit for LASIK surgery, candidates should be at least 18 years old, as refractive errors tend to stabilize by this age.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion:</b><br><br>

LASIK surgery offers a safe and effective solution for vision correction, providing many individuals with freedom from glasses or contact lenses. By understanding what to expect during LASIK surgery and who is a suitable candidate for the procedure, individuals can make informed decisions about their vision correction options. Consulting with an experienced eye surgeon is the first step in determining eligibility for LASIK surgery and achieving clearer vision and improved quality of life.<br><br>
